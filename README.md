MIMIC-III is a collection of comma separated value (CSV) files which contains detailed information regarding the clinical care of nearly 40,000 patients.

There are two key steps that must be completed before access is granted:
**the researcher must complete a recognized course in protecting human research participants that includes Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements.
